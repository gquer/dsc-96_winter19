    "Goal: Get a feel for A/B-testing using Permutation Tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common usages for A/B testing is for understanding the impact of changes to websites (e.g. website design changes, serving of different advertisements). For example, the website owner makes a small change to the layout of a webpage to a portion of the traffic and compares the user behavior on the old design against the user behavior on the new design. If there's a significant change in wanted behavior, the website owner will make the change on the entire website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters that a website owner needs to consider when executing an A/B test are:\n",
    "* The portion of website traffic that should make up the treatment group (i.e. users who see the changed website).\n",
    "* How long the AB-test should last.\n",
    "* The impact and level of confidence in the result of the test to declare it a \"success\". That is, you should be comfortable that the result of your test bring enough positive change (e.g. increase in revenue) and that it's not due to random flucuations in website traffic."

To illustrate this, read in data for another AB test here: `data/AB_test_time_series.csv`. \n",
