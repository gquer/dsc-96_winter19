    "# Python Data Structures: Beyond the Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of features, idioms, and data types for manipulating Python data structures that are worth being familiar with. Much of the material that follows in this course assumes this familiarity. An overview of some of these concepts are below. The goal of this tutorial is not necessarily for you to be able to use these patterns fluently, but to be able to recognize them and to start to be able to reason about what built-in Python data structures and functions are the best match for the problems and tasks you'll encounter.\n",

    "## List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common task in both data analysis and computer programming is applying some operation to every item in a list (e.g., scaling the numbers in a list by a fixed factor), or to create a copy of a list with only those items that match a particular criterion (e.g., eliminating values that fall below a certain threshold). Python has a succinct syntax, called a *list comprehension*, which allows you to easily write expressions that transform and filter lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension has a few parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a *source list*, or the list whose values will be transformed or filtered;\n",
    "- a *predicate expression*, to be evaluated for every item in the list; \n",
    "- (optionally) a *membership expression* that determines whether or not an item in the source list will be included in the result of evaluating the list comprehension, based on whether the expression evaluates to `True` or `False`; and\n",
    "- a *temporary variable name* by which each value from the source list will be known in the predicate expression and membership expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parts are arranged like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `[` *predicate expression* `for` *temporary variable name* `in` *source list* `if` *membership expression* `]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The words `for`, `in`, and `if` are a part of the syntax of the expression. They don't mean anything in particular (and in fact, they do completely different things in other parts of the Python language). You just have to spell them right and put them in the right place in order for the list comprehension to work.\n",

    "\"So,\" you think to yourself. \"Tuples are just like... broken lists. That's strange and a little unreasonable. Why even have them in your programming language?\" That's a fair question, and answering it requires a bit of knowledge of how Python works with these two kinds of values (lists and tuples) behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, tuples are *faster* and *smaller* than lists. Because lists can be modified, potentially becoming larger after they're initialized, Python has to allocate more memory than is strictly necessary whenever you create a list value. If your list grows beyond what Python has already allocated, Python has to allocate *more* memory. Allocating memory, copying values into memory, and then freeing memory when it's when no longer needed, are all (perhaps surprisingly) slow processes---slower, at least, than using data already loaded into memory when your program begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a tuple can't grow or shrink after it's created, Python knows exactly how much memory to allocate when you create a tuple in your program. That means: less wasted memory, and less wasted time allocating a deallocating memory. The cost of this decreased resource footprint is less versatility.\n",
