    "Today we talk about strings. When we have a string, we might want to ask whether it has particular characteristics---does it start with a particular character? Does it contain within it another string?---or try to extract smaller parts of the string, like the first fifteen characters, or say, the part of the string inside parentheses. Or we may want to transform the string into another string altogether, by (for example) converting its characters to upper case, or replacing substrings within it with other substrings. Today we discuss how to do these things in Python.\n",
