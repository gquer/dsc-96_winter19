# Week 4: Ethics

This is our final week with Tableau.  By the end of the week you will have built an interactive dashboard using the SDPD traffic stop data and put it online for the world to see.

The two big themes this week are:

1. Metrics and Answering Questions, and how to communicate results effectively.  
2. Ethical Research in Data Science by Prof. Camille Nebecker, UCSD
