    "In today's lecture, \"Images are Data!\" you learned that raster images are a esentially just arrays of numbers, and that these numbers can be manipulated to modify the image.  In this project we will use `Pillow` (a fork of the Python Image Library) and `numpy` to open, display,and manipulate images.\n",
