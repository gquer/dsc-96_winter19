    "# Image Processing 2: Manipulation Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Colin Jemmott, September 2018 for UC San Diego DSC 96.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm called `Error Level Analysis` that can provide hints about whether or not an image has been manipulated (aka \"Photoshopped\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is described in section 3.4.2 of [\"A Picture's Worth... Digital Image Analysis and Forensics, Version 2\"](http://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-08/Krawetz/Whitepaper/bh-dc-08-krawetz-WP.pdf) by Neal Krawetz. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get your implementation of the algorithm working, run it on the provided images `bear.jpg`, `geisel.jpg`, `CIMG4940ALL.jpg` and `beach.jpg`, as well as a few `.jpg` images that you think might be manipulated.  Explain the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "A big part of being a data scientist is having a problem, finding some relevant research, and implementing that research to test if it will work as a solution to your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading all of section 3.4.2 of \"A Picture's Worth...\" will help you to understand and explain your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "More unusual [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.2.x/) functions that I found helpful include `ImageChops` and `ImageEnhance`.  Of course, multiple solutions are possible, so don't feel the need to use those.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "If you finish early, look at some other image manipulation detection algorithms in [Krawetz](http://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-08/Krawetz/Whitepaper/bh-dc-08-krawetz-WP.pdf) and implement those also.\n"
