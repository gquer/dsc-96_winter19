# Readings for the week

readings paint a picture of the dangers of such convenience.

is relatively easy to understand. Though these techniques have
dramatically improved (e.g. hiding commands in arbitrary youtube
videos) since publication, this article is worth reading:

This webpage gives a demo of how to hide audio commands:
