# Week 6: Audio

This week focuses on audio recordings as a source of data.

We will start by learning a little about how computers store audio recordings, and then create our own from scratch in Python. Next, we will start with a recording of a voice and do some simple digital signal processing to remove long pauses. Finally, we will use a pre-made API to do speech recognition.

By the end of the week you will:

* Know how audio signals can be created and modified with code
* Have done some digital signal processing (DSP)
* Examined the sensitivity of speech recognition to noise.

## Pulling new material from the repository

The follow steps allow you to pull new class material to your
jupyterhub server

0. Make sure to rename any files you've been working on to a filename
   *not* present in the repository.
1. Log into JupyterHub and open a terminal (`New` > `Terminal`)
2. Change directories into the project: type `cd DSC96`
3. Pull down the newest material: type `git pull origin master`
