# Readings for Getting Started (thanks to Aaron Fraenkel)

Much of the readings for this course are taken from popular
publications that do a good job of communicating arguments using
data. A partial list of these publications are:

* [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
* [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot)
* [ProPublica Nerd Blog](https://www.propublica.org/nerds)

# Readings for the week

1. [Bussed out. How America Moves its homeless](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study)

'Bussed out' required journalists to engage in large-scale data
collection and significant data analysis, along with the resulting
storytelling and visualization. The story excels at humanizing the
problem while maintaining perspective about the magnitude of the
problem.

2. [Hidden spy planes](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/hidden-spy-planes)

'Hidden spy planes' uses data and machine learning to enable an
investigation into mysterious military-like aircraft in American
airspace. Making public claims based on such data-driven results
requires careful reasoning and verification -- indeed, the machine
learning was merely the start of the investigation.

3. [French election results: Macron'€™s victory in charts](https://www.ft.com/content/62d782d6-31a7-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a)

This Financial Times article visually describes the French election
results along a number of commonly used dimensions: geography, age,
income level, education level, and passing time.

4. Kirill Eremenko, Confident Data Skills,  Chapter 1

Thinking about all the ways that data is generated.
