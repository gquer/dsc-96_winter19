# Getting Started: Counting

The getting started project initially guides you through exercises to
get comfortable manipulated and analyzing data. The project uses
Tableau, so that you can get familiar with working with data without
the overhead of learning and setting up a more sophisticated coding
environment (later projects assume you have a python environment
installed). 

By the end of this module you will be able to:
* answer basic questions about a dataset by aggregating and visualizing data
* create an interactive dashboard to share your results

## Part I

This module will start with guided exercises to learn Tableau using
the `Lobbying.csv` dataset. The guided exercises are based on 
[this tutorial](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qh0ilvpbdi1aut/Basic_Tableau_Viz.pdf?dl=0).

## Part II

After you get comfortable manipulating data, you will explore the
`titanic.csv` data on your own. In this open ended module, try to
understand the fields in the dataset. Begin by asking basic questions
about "what happened" and attempt to answer them using Tableau.

As you develop the details of a story of what happened using the
titanic dataset, you're encouraged to compare and elaborate on aspects
of your story with other data found
[elsewhere](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/). Try to understand
the limits of the dataset to answer questions you may have about the
event. When might you need other data?
