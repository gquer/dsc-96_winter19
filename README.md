## Description

During this course you will familiarize with the process of answering questions using data. You will design several projects, all hands-on and open-ended. You will complete the projects using Tableau (Project 1), then Jupyter notebooks (Projects 2-3). We are interested in three big questions:
* Present: What happened?
* Past: Why did it happen?
* Future: What will happen?
You will work with a variety of data types and you will be exposed to common data issues: data's limitations and messiness.

By the time you finish this class, you will be able to:
* Identify problems that are good candidates for data science,
* Reframe the problem in a way that can be answered with the available data,
* Evaluate the limitations and quirks of the data,
* Manipulate the data to answer relevant questions, and
* Communicate the results clearly.

## How this class works
This class operates as a data science lab class, meaning that the bulk of time in class is spent practicing data science.  Formal lectures will be minimal, and meant to help you understand the tasks and the context.

All the needed analysis and coding should be performed inside class (unless we get behind), though you are encouraged to expand on the projects and see how much you can do!  There is significant reading outside of class, and it is important to keep up with the reading because of the limited formal instruction during class time.

## Projects
Projects are worked on during class and must be turned in to the instructor via email by the due date below.  Please include "[DSC 96 Wi19 Project #]" in the subject line and attach the corresponding Tableau workbook or Jupyter notebook. You should not need to work on the projects outside of class, but are encouraged to expand on the project and clean up the
presentation if you are motivated. A little extra work can make a great project to show off on your resume.

### Project due dates:
* SDPD traffic stops Tableau project (Due 01/30)
* Favorite of the "why did it happen?" (Due 02/26)
* SDPD traffic stops final project (Due 03/14)

## Assigned readings (journal material)

There are loosely related readings scheduled concurrently with the projects, intended to get you thinking about larger issues in data science. These are found in the `readings.md` file in each project. A journal response to the readings are 24 hours before every Thursday class.

### Reading journals
Each week, at least 24 hours before the start of the Thursday class, you must write me a paragraph or two about the weekly reading and send it via email to gquer@ucsd.edu. The goal of this is to have a more in-depth conversation than our class time allows. Think of these journals more as emails to discuss something you read with a colleague than as a formal essay.

The topic is up to you, but examples include:
* Relating a topic in the reading to something in your life or in the news,
* Asking a thoughtful question about the reading, or
* Picking a quote from the reading that you agree or disagree with and explaining why.

I may bring up what you write to me in class unless you explicitly ask
me in that email not to.

## Assessments and grades
This class is graded on a Pass/Not Pass scale.  Your course grade consists of the following components:

Percentage | Component
--- | ---
20% | Class Participation
20% | Journals 
20% | SDPD traffic stops Tableau project
20% | Best assignment of úWhy did it happen?Äù
20% | SDPD traffic stops final project

The final grade is computed using the following range:
* Pass: 70%-100%
* Not Pass: 0%-69%

## Class participation
Attendance is critical because the bulk of the coding happens in a collaborative manner during class time.  Of course, you may have to miss class due to illness, a family emergency, or similar reason. If this happens, you should let the instructor know by email as soon as possible (preferably before class).  You will still be responsible for completing the in-class work. Without the collaboration and explanations that happen in class, this will be much more difficult, so I strongly recommend coming to the office hours for help.  **In-class assignments from a missed class will not be accepted after the following class meeting.**

## Paired programming
Some coding will be by yourself, and some will be paired programming, meaning that you will work together with a partner to complete tasks. In both cases you are encouraged to ask for help from the instructor or from other students. This is a collaborative environment, which means that while in this classroom it is ok to show your work to other students and discuss it openly.

However, even in this collaborative environment, the work you do must be your own.  Specifically, you must do the actual work of completing the assignment (i.e. typing out the code, moving the mouse) and understand what your code or analysis is doing.

If you are unsure about if what you are doing is ok, just ask!  You will never be reprimanded in this class for asking for
clarification. Also note that this is likely a different standard than your other classes.

## Academic Integrity
For this class, the key to academic integrity is accurately representing the status and authorship of your work. I strongly
encourage you to read [the official UCSD policy on integrity of scholarship](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2).


## Diversity and Inclusion
I am committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our diversity of perspectives, experiences and identities. You, as a student in this course, are also responsible for maintaining an environment where your fellow students feel safe and respected.

In my opinion, the key to this is recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of every person.  If there is a way you could feel more included please let me know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door. 
 
## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting accommodations, please contact [Office for Students with Disabilities](https://students.ucsd.edu/well-being/disability-services/).
You must have documentation from the the Office before accommodations can be granted.
