# Readings for the week

1. Gaming the college rankings

College Rankings are derived from models that are supposed to capture
what makes a school successful. However, as college rankings influence
the future success of colleges, many schools try to game the ranking
system -- i.e. the rankings changing what they are attempting
to measure. This is commonly referred to as a "feedback loop".

These stories touch on a few few common themes: that you shouldn't
trust data at face value, that you should try to be aware of *how*
your data is created, and that messy data, such missing data, can
drastically effect the statistics of what's being measured.
