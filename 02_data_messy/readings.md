1. Gaming the college rankings

College Rankings are derived from models that are supposed to capture
what makes a school successful. However, as college rankings influence
the future success of colleges, many schools try to game the ranking
system -- i.e. the rankings changing what they are attempting
to measure. This is commonly referred to as a "feedback loop".

These stories touch on a few few common themes: that you shouldn't
trust data at face value, that you should try to be aware of *how*
your data is created, and that messy data, such missing data, can
drastically effect the statistics of what's being measured.

## Further Reading

[Guide to messy data for journalists](https://qz.com/572338/the-quartz-guide-to-bad-data/)
contains a good checklist for questioning the quality of a dataset. This is a good way to go deeper and check how data can be messy, and what can we do with it!

[This collection of "falsehoods programmers believe in"](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) is worth a good
look every time you start to work with a new type of data.  A good
example is 
[Falsehoods programmers believe about time](https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time),
which starts with "There are always 24 hours in a day."

[The Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) has data, tutorials, and links to some of the best work data scientists are doing with police data.  Thanks to Jan Overgoor from that group for helping with resources for how to approach the SDPD data.

Review some of the concepts introduced in the class about missing data, and some of the common solutions with implementations in Python code:
