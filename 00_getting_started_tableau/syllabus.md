## Description

This sequence of projects familiarizes the you with the process of
answering questions using data. The projects are hands-on and
open-ended.  They are meant to be completed first using Tableau
(Project 1), then Jupyter notebooks (Projects 2-4). The projects
attempt to answer the three big questions:
* What happened?
* Why did it happen?
* What will happen?
They use a variety of data types and exposes you to
data's limitations and messiness.

By the time you finish this class, you will be able to:
* Identify problems that are good candidates for data science,
* Reframe the problem in a way that can be answered with the available data,
* Evaluate the limitations and quirks of the data,
* Manipulate the data to answer relevant questions, and
* Communicate the results clearly.

## How this class works
This class operates as a data science lab class, meaning that the bulk
of time in class is spent doing data science.  Formal lectures will be
minimal, and meant to help you understand the tasks and the context.

Unless we get behind, there should not be mandatory coding or
analytics work outside of class (though you are encouraged to expand
on the projects and see how much you can do!).  There is significant
reading outside of class, and it is important to keep up with the
reading because of the limited formal instruction during class time.

## Projects
Projects are worked on during class and must be turned in to the
instructor via email by the due date below.  Please include "[CSE 91
Fa18 Project]" in the subject line and attach Tableau workbook or
Jupyter notebook. You should not need to work on the projects outside
of class, but are encouraged to expand on the project and clean up the
presentation if you are motivated. A little extra work can make a
great project to show off on your resume.

### Project due dates:
* SDPD traffic stops Tableau project (Due 10/23)
* Favorite of the "why did it happen?" (Due 11/20)
* SDPD traffic stops final project (Due 12/06)

## Assigned readings (journal material)

There are loosely related readings scheduled concurrently with the
projects, intended to get you thinking about larger issues in data
science. These are found in the `readings.md` file in each project. A
journal response to the readings are due six days after starting a
module (one per line of the schedule) -- i.e. 24 hours before every
Thursday class.

### Reading journals
Each week, at least 24 hours before the start of the Thursday class,
you must write me a paragraph or two about the weekly reading and send
it via a private note in Piazza. The goal of this
is to have a more in-depth conversation than our class time
allows. Think of these journals more as emails to discuss something
you read with a colleague than as a formal essay.

The topic is up to you, but examples include:

* Relating a topic in the reading to something in your life or in the news,
* Asking a thoughtful question about the reading, or
* Picking a quote from the reading that you agree or disagree with and explaining why.

I may bring up what you write to me in class unless you explicitly ask
me in that email not to.

## Assessments and grades
This class is graded on a Pass/Not Pass scale.  Your course grade consists of the following components:

Percentage | Component
--- | ---
10% | Class Participation
20% | Journals 
30% | SDPD traffic stops Tableau project
20% | Best assignment of “Why did it happen?”
20% | SDPD traffic stops final project

The final grade is computed using the following range:
* Pass: 70%-100%
* Not Pass: 0%-69%

## Class participation
Attendance is critical because the bulk of the coding happens in a
collaborative manner during class time.  Of course, you may have to
miss class due to illness, a family emergency, or similar reason. If
this happens, you should let the instructor know by email as soon as
possible (preferably before class).  You will still be responsible for
completing the in-class work. Without the collaboration and
explanations that happen in class, this will be much more difficult,
so I strongly recommend coming to the office hours for help.  **In-class
assignments from a missed class will not be accepted after the
following class meeting.**

## Paired programming
Some coding will be by yourself, and some will be paired programming,
meaning that you will work together with a partner to complete tasks.
In both cases you are encouraged to ask for help from the instructor
or from other students. This is a collaborative environment, which
means that while in this classroom it is ok to show your work to other
students and discuss it openly.

However, even in this collaborative environment, the work you do must
be your own.  Specifically, you must do the actual work of completing
the assignment (i.e. typing out the code, moving the mouse) and
understand what your code or analysis is doing.

If you are unsure about if what you are doing is ok, just ask!  You
will never be reprimanded in this class for asking for
clarification. Also note that this is likely a different standard than
your other classes.

## Academic Integrity
For this class, the key to academic integrity is accurately
representing the status and authorship of your work.  I strongly
encourage you to read [the official UCSD policy on integrity of scholarship](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2).


## Diversity and Inclusion
I am committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our
diversity of perspectives, experiences and identities. You, as a
student in this course, are also responsible for maintaining an
environment where your fellow students feel safe and respected.

In my opinion, the key to this is recognizing the inherent worth and
dignity of every person.  If there is a way you could feel more
included please let me know, either in person, via email/discussion
board, or even in a note under the door. 
 
## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting
accommodations, please contact [Office for Students with Disabilities](https://students.ucsd.edu/well-being/disability-services/).
You must have documentation from the the Office before accommodations
can be granted.
