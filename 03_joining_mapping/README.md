# Week 3: Joining, Metrics and Questions

This week we dive deeper into the SDPD 2016 traffic stop data from week 2.  This week we will cover two important topics:

## Joining

Often a single data source does not have all of the information that we need.  Joining two data sets on a common field is one way to bring in more data.

Using the SDPD data from last week as the base, we will join on data about race and a table with additional details about each stop.

## Metrics and Answering Questions

A big part of data science is using math and data to answer questions.  But how do you translate questions into equations?

For example, we might ask if traffic enforcement is fair with respect to gender.  An initial examination shows that men are pulled over twice as often as women.  But do they drive twice as much?  Twice as recklessly?  What data could we use to get at the big picture?
