1. [We'€™re Measuring the Economy All Wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/columnists/great-recession-economy-gdp.html)
   
Much of working in data science consists of translating your intuition
into quantitative measurements. The NY Times article discusses the
historical circumstances under which unemployment rates were first
measured. Over the years, myriad policy decisions have been made based
on this measurement. While the economy is experiencing record low
unemployment rates, there are other aspects that aren't capture with
this statistic (such as rising inequality). 

2. [New Statistical Methods](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-flawed-statistical-method-was-just-banned-from-a-major-sports-science-journal/)

Once we decide on what we want to measure, we have to construct an
argument using those measurements. Generally, different subject
domains have different norms and standards for what makes a convincing
argument. However, when certain questions remain stubbornly
intractable to existing "standard" analyses, researchers will use
new or nonstandard techniques to try to make their point. Sometimes
these techniques become accepted and sometime they are deemed
unconvincing.

3. Eremenko Ch 4, Identify the Question

4. [Racial Disparities in Illinois Traffic Stops](https://illinoistrafficstops.com/)

An interesting story obtained analyzing a similar dataset as the one we are working with. Strong conclusions are driven like "Across the state of Illinois, Latin and black drivers are searched, subjected to dog sniff tests, and given citations at significantly higher rates than white drivers when stopped by Illinois law enforcement."
"Clearly, there is a problem. We hope this report will serve as a resource to help law enforcement agencies make informed improvements around racial disparities for the good of their officers and the people they serve."
See what the data representation used, and try to understand if the results may be interpreted in a different way.
