# Week 7: Unstructured Text


This week we will be working with unstructured data, specifically text data.  On the first day we will use the Python package NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit) to analyze tweets and learn a little about natural language processing (NLP).  On day 2 we will explore getting data from the internet, including best practices for scraping data.
This week focuses on audio recordings as a source of data.

## Pulling new material from the repository

As usual, the following steps allow you to pull new class material to your
jupyterhub server:

0. Make sure to rename any files you've been working on to a filename
   *not* present in the repository.
1. Log into JupyterHub and open a terminal (`New` > `Terminal`)
2. Change directories into the project: type `cd DSC96`
3. Pull down the newest material: type `git pull origin master`
